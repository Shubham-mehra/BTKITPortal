			Original contributions from researchers describing their original, unpublished, research contribution which is not currently under review by another conference or journal and addressing state-of-the-art research are invited to share their work in all areas of Smart and Innovative trends.
			<br>
			Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings and submitted to the IEEE-Digital Library and EI Index. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register and present their work at the conference; otherwise, the paper will not be included in the proceedings. Best Paper/Demo Awards will be presented to high-quality papers/demos.
			<br>
			The ICACCE 2019 Organizing Committee also invites proposals for workshops associated with the conference, addressing research areas related to the conference. Accepted workshop papers will be included in the proceedings. Please send workshop proposals to icacce.in@gmail.com.
			<br>
			Submission of paper has to be double-blind : the name/s of the author/s are omitted when the paper is submitted to EasyChair paper submission link.
